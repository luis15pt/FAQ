Warning - "Invalid SSH public key"
=====================================

If you are prompted with the following message "Invalid SSH public key", when trying to add a new SSH key, you have to check:

    - ``Name``, as there might be some unsafe characters() used - **"Name contains unsafe characters"**
    - ``Key Content``, as the SSH public key added might be invalid - **"Invalid SSH public key."**
