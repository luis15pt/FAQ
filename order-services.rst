Billing / Order Services
========================

On this page the end-user can see the services that are available for him to order. They are displayed as card items like in the following image.

Only products that have a ``Public`` status are shown for the end-user.

In order to create a new service that an end-user can order, you need to login as staff and create a new product. More on product creation: :doc:`here </staff/billing-products>`.

After you create a new product, it will appear on the ``Order services`` page on the end-user panel. Pressing the ``Order`` button from the bottom of a card will send the user to a confirmation page ( like in the following image ) where he can choose the payment cycle then save the item to the cart and finish the order.
